        <p>This website is built using data from the TMDB API, allowing users to access movies, recommendations, and filtered searches, as well as other features. We chose this topic because we thought it would be an interesting project to build and could be used in a normal setting. </p>
        <p>We found this API through research on GitHub and other sources and took some inspiration for the formatting from streaming platforms like Netflix. </p>
